# Gulp: Separated Tasks

This project demonstrates how to easily separate gulp tasks into different js files.
Every file in the `gulpfile.js/tasks` folder is automatically loaded.

## Pre-requirements

NodeJS and NPM are mandatory. It is also required to install gulp globally:
```
npm i -g gulp
```

## How to run
First install every required dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then run one the task defined in the `gulpfile.js/tasks` folder:

```
gulp (sass|copy...)
```
